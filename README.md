# Enabling an IoT reference architecture in AWS and Solace

Set up a demo IoT reference architecture in AWS for QoS0 and QoS1 messaging to core applications and QoS0 messaging to edge applications.

## Overview

This project provides a guide to enabling an IoT reference architecture in AWS. The IoT reference architecture itself is evolving along with the features/functionality within it. Therefore this is one phase of a work in progress that will evolve with reference architecture itself.

The project provides an easy to understand set of steps to bring up a Solace messaging IoT infrastructure in AWS as well as provides a basic set of tests to validate the infrastructure and demonstrate Solace messaging functionality in AWS.

## Documentation
